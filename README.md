This project is created strictly for educational and testing purposes.

It is designed to demonstrate how Discord bots can interact with structured text data (such as .txt files) and return information in an embedded, user-friendly format.
The bot does not actively fetch, trace, or retrieve live Xbox IP addresses, nor does it connect to Xbox servers, online databases, or any third-party APIs.

All responses are generated solely from a static, locally provided file (users.txt) that you, the user, manually create and maintain.

By using this bot, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

✅ It is intended only for learning, experimenting, or internal testing.

🚫 It must not be used for real-time data scraping, network attacks, or any form of unauthorized access.

📚 You accept full responsibility for how this tool is deployed, and agree to use it ethically and legally.

Any misuse of this bot falls outside the scope of its intended purpose and is strongly discouraged.
